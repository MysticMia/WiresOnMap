### Introduction
Do you have large teleporter lines in your world? Or do you make complicated wire creations that you want to see on the world map? This mod makes it possible to show these wires and teleporters on your map!


## Features
There is currently support for the 4 vanilla wires and the teleporter. The overlay is drawn on the world map and the minimap.

### Configurations
#### Configuration menu
- Show or hide all teleporters.
- Change the thickness of wires.
- Hide and fade wires in unloaded areas (fog of war).
- Change the wire color (and opacity) of each individual wire.
#### Other configurations
- Click the wire visibility buttons in your inventory (Forced/Faded/Classic). "Forced" will make the wire show on the map.

### Future ideas
- Show logic gates and timers?
- Toggle world map or mini map visibility.
