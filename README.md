### Introduction
Do you have large teleporter lines in your world? Or do you make complicated wire creations that you want to see on the world map? This mod makes it possible to show these wires and teleporters on your map!

To use this mod, simply load a world and place a few wires. The map updates whenever you break or place wires.

The visibility of wires depends on your wire viewing settings in your inventory:
- Set "Mechanical Display" to "Forced" (not "Normal")
- Set the wires you want to view to "Bright" (not "Faded" or "Classic")

## Features
There is currently support for the 4 vanilla wires and the teleporter. The overlay is drawn on the world map and the minimap.

### Configurations
#### Configuration menu
Config options:
- Toggle the mod with "Wires On Map Enabled". This can be useful if you want to disable the mod and wire rendering without leaving the game.
- Show teleporters
- Change the of the wires that are drawn on the map.
- Show wires in undiscovered areas by disabling "Hide Wires In Fog Of War".
- ^ You can choose to make unmapped areas render a faded version of the wire by enabling "Fade Wires In Fog Of War" to multiply their opacity by "Opacity Multiplier".
- Change the color (and opacity) of each wire.
- Debugging messages, whenever the map is updated or drawn (the second one may be spammy, as it draws the map layer each game tick).

#### Other configurations
- Click the wire visibility buttons in your inventory (Forced/Faded/Classic). "Forced" will make the wire show on the map.

### Future ideas
- Show logic gates and timers?
- Toggle world map or mini map visibility.
