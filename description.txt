Show your favorite wires on your minimap and world map!

This mod lets you render the red, blue, green, and yellow wires on maps. To use this mod, simply load a world and place a few wires. The map updates whenever you break or place wires.

The visibility of wires depends on your wire viewing settings in your inventory:
- Set "Mechanical Display" to "Forced" (not "Normal")
- Set the wires you want to view to "Bright" (not "Faded" or "Classic")

Config options:
- Toggle the mod with "Wires On Map Enabled". This can be useful if you want to disable the mod and wire rendering without leaving the game.
- Show teleporters.
- Change the of the wires that are drawn on the map.
- Show wires in undiscovered areas by disabling "Hide Wires In Fog Of War".
- ^ You can choose to make unmapped areas render a faded version of the wire by enabling "Fade Wires In Fog Of War" to multiply their opacity by "Opacity Multiplier".
- Change the color of each wire.
- Debugging messages, whenever the map is updated or drawn (the second one may be spammy, as it draws the map layer each game tick).


Known issues:
- In multiplayer, the client only receives tiles 300x300 around the player. As a result, the player can't render wires for the entire map. Proposal: Add server-side mod that sends/syncs to client. For now: manually explore the map, and it will cache the data automatically (until you leave the world).
